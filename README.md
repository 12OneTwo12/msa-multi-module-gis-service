### **🚀 MSA Multi-Module GIS Service**  

📌 **Repository Type:** Experimental / Learning Project  
📌 **Purpose:** Testing and learning various technologies related to **MSA (Microservices Architecture)** and **spatial data processing**  

---

## **📝 Overview**  
This repository is a sandbox project for exploring and experimenting with:  
- **Microservices Architecture (MSA) with Spring Cloud**  
- **Spatial data processing and GIS-related functionalities**  
- **Code coverage analysis with JaCoCo**  

The project is **not production-ready** but serves as a learning resource for integrating different technologies in an MSA environment.  

---

## **🚀 Technologies Applied**  
✅ **Spring Cloud** (Eureka, Gateway)  
✅ **Spatial Data Processing** (H2GIS, PostGIS, JTS, etc.)  
✅ **JaCoCo** (Code coverage measurement)  
✅ **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD pipeline setup)

## **📌 Notes**  
- This repository is purely for **learning and experimentation**.  
- Some configurations may be incomplete or not optimized for real-world use.  
- New technologies and concepts may be added over time as part of ongoing exploration.  

🚀 **For learning purposes only!** 🚀
