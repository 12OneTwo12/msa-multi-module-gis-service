### **🚀 MSA Multi-Module GIS Service**

📌 **Repository Type:** Experimental / Learning Project  
📌 **Purpose:** Testing and learning various technologies related to **MSA (Microservices Architecture)** and **spatial
data processing**

---

## **📝 Overview**

This repository is a sandbox project for exploring and experimenting with:

- **Microservices Architecture (MSA) with Spring Cloud, Java, Kotlin**
- **Spatial data processing and GIS-related functionalities**

The project is **not production-ready** but serves as a learning resource for integrating different technologies in an
MSA environment.
